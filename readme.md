# Servish

A simple webserver for serving a single folder.

Written for Node.js to help with my web development.

Should manage to serve files, but nothing fancy.

My first Node.js project.

## Install

`npm install -g servish`

## Usage

In the folder you wish to serve use `servish` and it will be served.
